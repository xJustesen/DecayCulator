> *A terminal calculator haunted by entropy, blessed by uncertainty.*

## ðŸ¤¯ But why?
For too long, the rules of mathematics have lived in denial. They pretend the world is clean. Ordered. Predictable. That `2 + 2` will **always** equal `4`.

But we know better.
We live in **chaotic times**.
We embrace **entropy**.
We reject the sterile idealism of floating point precision.

Itâ€™s time for a calculator that reflects **reality**. A calculator where **numbers decay**. Where **buttons glitch**. Where **even your inputs forget what they were**.

## ðŸš€ Try It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xJustesen/decayCulator.git
cd decayCulator
make setup
make run
```

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters
The world is unpredictable. Your calculator should be too. This isnâ€™t just a calculator. Itâ€™s a philosophy. A celebration of uncertainty. A rebellion against precision. A tool for embracing the chaotic beauty of modern life.
